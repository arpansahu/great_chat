## Postgresql Server

IT would be a nightmare to have your own vps to save cost and not hosting your own postgresql server.

For more information, see the [README of PostgreSql Server With Nginx Setup](https://github.com/arpansahu/common_readme/blob/main/AWS%20Deployment/Postgres.md).

postgresql_server can be access accessed

## PGAdmin4

pgAdmin 4 is a complete rewrite of pgAdmin, built using Python and Javascript/jQuery. A desktop runtime written in NWjs allows it to run standalone for individual users, or the web application code may be deployed directly on a web server for use by one or more users through their web browser.
